So... you've been gone a while.

I finally managed to finish chapter eight of Heroine Rises which is titled *All that Glitters*.

Click [here](/heroine-rises/7/0) to read the eigth chapter of Heroine Rises!

In this chapter Julian and Juliette question the NSPD's Ashley Carter and Maxine Rubin about the mysterious housekeeper Irene Lassiter while Madeline interviews the local jeweler.

I took a pretty long break from making the comics, almost all of June. During that time I worked on anatomy and writing as well as trying out some new art mediums.  

The first few pages of this chapter were created the same way I made every chapter until now - using Borden and Riley Paris Paper folded in half and making the panels on top of that. Except that the panels didn't really exist because the B&R paper didn't have much of a border and I wasn't going to spend hours making sure I have a properly measured border.

Wanting to make my comics a bit more 'professional' looking, I looked into various brands of comic paper - paper that handles ink as well as the B&R I had been using but with guides and lines to help me with the process of making actual panels. I eventually settled on trying some Deleter Type A Comic Paper and really liked using this over the other paper. It took some time to get used to inking the panels and I started to wonder if the extra effort was really worth it. Now that the pages are finished, I really like this new look and realized that I'll get faster as I get used to it.

I also toned the pages with a black colored pencil but as of now I'm not sure if I'll continue this. I'll continue to tone it traditionally but I found it was hard to tone large areas with the pencil so maybe I'll grab a few grey colored art markers and try them out? Or maybe I'll try my hand at watercoloring the panels! Who knows?

The next chapter is titled : *The Dangers of Serenity* and unless I decide to switch up the process again, I would say to expect a release about a month from now. 

Until next time!
