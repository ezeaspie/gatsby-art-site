It's finally ready - the sixth chapter of Heroine Rises, titled **Ada, Robert, and the Ring** is finally up on the reader.

Click [here](/heroine-rises/5/0) to read the sixth chapter of Heroine Rises!

In this chapter Madeline meets Robert Silva, the wealthy but arrogant husband of Ada Lima. 

This chapter took a while to get done. I initally said it would take two weeks but the chapter was too long to condense into the usual two week - 12 page timeline. This chapter spans 16 pages and is the same length as [Chapter 5, The First Case](/heroine-rises/4/0). That chapter took three weeks so this one did too. The one week hiatus I took after finishing that chapter is overall why this one is out a month later. Sorry, I'll try to do better next time.

I don't know if I can give a hard deadline as to when the next chapter - titled "The Daughter of the NSPD" will be out... but know that I'm working on it and if it's not out in two weeks - it'll be out the third with extra pages. Chapters are getting longer and more detailed so I don't know if the two week schedule is feasable unless I *really* speed up the process somehow. 

Anyway, about this chapter. *Ada, Robert, and the Ring* was one where I really hammered home the backgrounds issue. Not every panel has a background, but the setting is clear and visible! 
As for the dialouge, I decided to do a stylized speech bubble of sorts. I think this might stay since it takes too long to do them digitally and I can't draw good oval shapes! The text is done digitally but I really need to tighten up the scripts to speed up this part. The dialouge is slightly different than what's on the script and having to refer to the comic drawings instead of simple copy-pasting would really speed up the process and let me focus on other parts.

Like toning! Toning is back in a small way. I had enough time to color in some parts. I found a few digital screentone brushes and I really like them alot better than the simple flat tones I used before. Tones will be added from now on with these pattern brushes to give the pages a bit more life!

I'm quite proud of the chapter and I really hope you enjoy it.
