Iâ€™ve been making tons of art, mostly working on my Heroine Rises series. I drew up a chapter (Finally, I know.) and inked it. I might share it later on. I also started another chapter but took a break from it because I got inspired halfway through. I'm not sure if I have the skill needed to make it look somewhat like I want it to - but maybe I should'nt wait for a *perfect* time to draw it or else... I'll never even get started on it.

Moving on, about this piece.

I've been looking at art from different time periods to get a sense of what I want from *my* art. During this, I fell in love with pop art and all it is. The bold colors and heavy black weighted lines were eye catching and I wanted to do a study of it. For *Oh Julie*, I decided to copy the subject of a woman's face close-up with the dialouge being just a critical to the composition as the actual art. While this one was a bit less deep in terms of subject matter, I have other ideas that might be more striking and achieve what I want. But that's a bit off in the future right now.

The black ink lines were done with ink (Sakura Micron Pigma Pens) on paper before I scanned them into the computer and added color with GIMP.
