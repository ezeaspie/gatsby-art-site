In this chapter, Madeline Harbour and Julian Gaitan head home after the events of **Small Time Detective** and talk about Madeline's future and what she needs to do in order to become the *heroine* she dreams of. 

I started pencilling these pages as soon as I finished up with **Small Time Detective**. I was worried because this chapter felt like it took quite some time to finish but I realized that's because I actually bothered to draw backgrounds for the most part and I also drew *much* more panels in this one than any other comic thus far.

I'm proud of it. I also got a few brush pens for this chapter and inking has been a joy with them! I still use pens for details and thin lines since my hands can be quite shaky!

I hope that the art can stay consistent and grow as the series chugs along!

Chapter 3 is called **Sassy Steel** and based on the time-frame I made this chapter in - I think it should be released in about two weeks time. I'm trying to get faster at drawing so I can churn out more pages more often but that looks like it'll take time.
