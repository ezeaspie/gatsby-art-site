Chapter One of *Heroine Rises* is now avaliable in full on the Reader! 

Click [here](/heroine-rises/0/0) to check it out:

This chapter is titled **Small Time Detective** and introduces us to the characters of Madeline Harbour and Julian Gaitan, main protaganists of the series!

I actually penciled these pages back in the summer of 2018, but only recently decided to ink them because if I didn't, I don't think I ever will.

I want 2019 to be the year where *Heroine Rises* *FINALLY* takes shape. The shading and art might be a bit wonky because my art has developed since the summer but I hope I can remedy that in future chapters in where I will create pencils from scratch and get some brush pens to better ink the panels. 

Stay tuned for updates!
