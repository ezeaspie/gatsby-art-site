Chapter Three of *Heroine Rises* - titled **Sassy Steel** is now avaliable in full on the Reader! 

Click [here](/heroine-rises/2/0) to check it out!

This chapter picks up where **To Become a Heroine** left off. Madeline goes home but before confronting her mother, she decides to ask Juliette Sandover - one of her more sassy friends - to join her investigative team!

As I'm writing this, I realized I forgot to add the text that tells you Juliette's full name. Oops. I think there might also be a panel where I forgot to draw Juliette's freckles. Turns out my memory isn't as good as I belived it to be. I'll write those things down from now on.

This chapter has one more page in it than the rest but it was still completed in the same time frame! I also got the cover page in and added color! I am getting faster and it feels great. I worked at least an hour a day on this chapter for the past two weeks and for 13/14 days - I kept up with the 'one page a day' pace I tried to set. I hope I can keep it up and avoid burnout for the future!

I decided to not tone the comics from now on. I find that it does not add much to the comic artistically because I just feel so laboured to do it. It comes off lazy and rushed. It eats up alot of time at the end of the process for very little gain. And it also makes me realize how much I avoid drawing backgrounds. I think that the time I spend toning would be better spent shoring up backgrounds and making sure everything is consistent. I would also like to create more colored cover pages.

Chapter 4 is titled **Mother's Concerns** and is scheduled to come out in another two weeks. We *finally* get to meet Madeline's mother and will get to see where Madeline gets her drive and dreams from! Will Madeline convince her mother to let her investigate? Or will her mother play spoiler in the name of safety?
