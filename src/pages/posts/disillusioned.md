I just added the first ever entire chapter I wrote for *Heroine Rises*. If you look closely - you'll notice that there is no Madeline Harbour! Why is that? 

When I started with the idea for Heroine Rises, the protaganist I had in mind was this character called **Maxine Rubin** - arrogant, reckless, hardy, but wholly sworn to work for 'Justice and the Greater Good'. 

This chapter was meant to be the first of many for this Maxine lead *Heroine Rises* but at some point, I decided to change gears and place **Madeline Harbour** as the main protaganist. 

The art in this is pretty poor because it was the first full length chapter I went for. Once I finished it and looked back on it to find ways to improve my comic drawing - I noticed that the character's faces lack consistency and my little experiment with cross hatching in replacement for shading *didn't* work out how I wanted. As a result, I changed my style to focus more on weighted lines than cross hatches which is what is prominent now in *Heroine Rises*. I also drew up some character references so I wouldn't subconciously change a character's face here and there. There are also issues with speech bubbles and the flow of the pages but I'll save that for another day.

Note that this chapter (only 8 pages) took me over **THREE WEEKS** to finish. Comics are no jokes. Massive respect for those artists who churn out quality pages on a schedule. 

The amount of time it took to finish this convinced me that I would never finish any comic series in a reasonable time frame so I temporarily shelved the idea of *Heroine Rises*. But I came back and nowadays I'm still pretty slow (Anywhere between 4-6 pages a week) but I can confidently say that I am getting faster and that the art is of higher quality. The current goal is a page a day - pencils and ink - but we're still not quite *that* fast yet.

Anyway, back to the chapter at hand.

Maxine is a fantastic character that I still have plenty of plans for in the future, but I feel that while Maxine's Heroine Rises story could be great - Madeline would be a better character to try to lead the narrative I want with. We'll get the story of Maxine Rubin later on in the story, but I wanted to put this up to have something of a reminder that Madeline was not the first choice for a main character.
